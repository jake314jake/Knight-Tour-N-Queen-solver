## Knight's Tour :

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.
If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square
(so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant);
otherwise, it is open.

## N-Queen :

The N queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N*N chessboard
so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century.
